# 💳 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. It was developed in Google Colab and explores data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 File
- `Fraud_Detection.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the code, explanations, and outputs.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Financial fraud is a major issue across industries. This notebook uses a dataset with heavily imbalanced classes (fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions) to train classification models that can help identify potentially fraudulent activity.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Handling imbalanced classes with undersampling
- Building and evaluating classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Requirements
You can run the notebook directly on **Google Colab** with no setup.
Don't forget to add your OWN KAGGLE API FILE in the Notebook

If running locally:
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install via:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


▶️ How to Run
Open Google Colab

Upload or open Fraud_Detection.ipynb

Run the cells step-by-step

📊 Example Output
Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to evaluate model performance.

📌 Note
This is a beginner-friendly project designed for learning purposes. In real-world applications, additional steps like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced sampling techniques would be required.
